    "date": "Apr 2024 – May 2024",
    "description": "Built a full-stack hotel booking app (TypeScript, Node, Express, MongoDB, Tailwind). Features: auth, hotel management, image uploads, search, and payments.",
    "url": "https://github.com/scruuu/mern-booking-app",
    "problem": "Independent hotels lack the resources to build and maintain a comprehensive online booking system, making it difficult to compete with larger chains.",
    "solution": "Developed a full-stack MERN application providing hotels with a dashboard to manage bookings, room inventory, and pricing. The customer-facing side features secure payments, advanced search filters, and an intuitive booking process.",
    "impact": "The platform empowers small hotel owners to increase their online visibility, streamline operations, and boost direct bookings, reducing reliance on third-party booking sites and their high commission fees."
